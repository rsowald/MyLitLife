## Description

If you grew up reading Dr. Seuss, you have probably heard the quote: "The more you read, the more things you know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." With such words, Dr. Seuss inspired a generation of voracious readers to grow their reading lists to epic proportions. However, the bigger the reading list, the harder it is to track. That is why a good book tracker is imperative. The My Lit life app allows users to set reading goals, keep a to-read list, track thoughts on books they have read, and even load up the best sellers to their to-read list with the help of Google Books and The New York Times. 

On the dashboard, the user will see their current read and make notes or write reviews about it. They can add any recent books and their thoughts on them to their completed book list. There is also a bestseller carousel where they can add New York Times bestselling books to their reading list. We have even included a widget to search for word definitions with Merriam-Webster.

The book queue page is the powerhouse of the app. This is where the to-read list is created and where a user can move their books into a completed book list. The user may search for a new book using our search bar powered by the Google Books API. Then they use drag and drop technology to place their result's book card in columns of want to read or finished reading. Book cards can be dragged to and from any column as your current read changes.

When books are added to the completed books list, they can all be accessed from the completed books page. They user can open book details for any of these books and add notes, write a review, or share how they wished the book had ended.

This application is still in the early stage of development, so more features and an even better user experience are soon to come.
