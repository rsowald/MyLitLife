## Description

The app allows users to track their books and load up the best sellers with the help of Google Books and The New York Times. There is a second full page provided to the user for a drag and drop option to help place their books in columns of want to read, reading, and finished reading. We have also enabled the user to be able to search for word definitions with Merriam-Webster.

## Usage

As a user, I aim to read a certain number of books per month and able to clearly see where I am at with my goal. I want to create a list of books that I want to read and see which ones I have read after I finish them. I also want to keep track of my thoughts about the book as I am reading and after it is completed
